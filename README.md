# SQL-loan-approval-system

This project simulates a backend loan approval system using SQL and Python. It evaluates customer eligibility based on age, income, credit score, and requested loan amountâ€”using dynamic SQL logic and integrated analysis via Jupyter Notebook.

**Eligibility Criteria Logic**

Loan applications are evaluated using this SQL rule:

```sql
 CASE
  WHEN Age >= 21 AND CreditScore >= 700 AND Income >= (LoanAmount * 0.4)
  THEN 'Approved'
  ELSE 'Rejected'
 END
```

**Technologies Used**
MySQL (Relational Schema, Joins, Foreign Keys)

Python: Pandas, MySQL Connector

Jupyter Notebook: Query Execution & Visualization

**Outcome Summary**
Out of 40 loan applications:

     Status  TotalApplications
0  Approved                 31
1  Rejected                  9

**To Run This Project**
Create MySQL database loan_system

Execute schema.sql to build tables

Insert data manually or via data_insert.sql

Run notebooks/eligibility_query.ipynb to check prediction
