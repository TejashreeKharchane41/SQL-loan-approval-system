# SQL-loan-approval-system

**Project Overview:**

This project simulates a backend loan approval system using SQL and Python. It evaluates customer eligibility based on age, income, credit score, and requested loan amountâ€”leveraging dynamic SQL logic and integrated analysis via Jupyter Notebook.


**Eligibility Criteria Logic:**

Loan applications are evaluated using this SQL rule:

```sql
 CASE
  WHEN Age >= 21 AND CreditScore >= 700 AND Income >= (LoanAmount * 0.4)
  THEN 'Approved'
  ELSE 'Rejected'
 END
```

**Technologies Used:**

MySQL (Relational Schema, Joins, Foreign Keys)

Python: Pandas, MySQL Connector

Jupyter Notebook: Query Execution & Visualization

**Outcome Summary:**

Out of 40 loan applications:

 Approved                 31
 
 Rejected                  9

**To Run This Project:**

Create MySQL database loan_system

Execute schema.sql to build tables

Insert data manually or via dataset.sql

Run notebooks/loan_eligibility_check.ipynb to check prediction
